# Book_Sharing
## Overview

in college,there is always some student who has a certain book that is needed by another student.
In this project,we are trying to build a decentralized platform for students to share their books
## Features
1. owner of book can track his/her book in realtime.
2. Books will be secured using the fabric network.
3. The owner can remove his/her book from the platform.
